<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions to verify that Dynatrace OneAgent works with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify Your Dynatrace Add-on for PCF Installation

1. Check your Dynatrace environment for new monitored hosts.

2. [BOSH ssh](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh) into one of the VMs in your deployment.

3. Run `sudo su -` to enter the root environment with root privileges.

4. Run `monit summary`. Look for the following processes in the output:

    <pre class="terminal">The Monit daemon 5.2.5 uptime: 8d 11h 33m
    Process 'dynatrace-oneagent'        running</pre>

5. If `monit summary` does not list `dynatrace-oneagent`, check `/var/vcap/sys/log/dynatrace-oneagent/` logs for errors.

## <a id='known-limitations'></a>Known Limitations

### <a id="dynatrace-installation-issues"></a>p-invitations App Does Not Start

#### Symptom
Running the errands for installing AppsManager fails.

#### Explanation: Memory limit is too restrictive.
As part of deploying AppsManager, a number of apps are deployed to the Elastic Runtime. Starting `p-invitations-*` and `apps-manager-js-*` apps might fail due to restrictive memory limits.

#### Solution
In the Dynatrace UI, go to **Settings** > **Monitoring overview** and select the **Process groups** tab. Search for the `p-invitations` and `apps-manager-js` process groups disable monitoring for these groups.

Re-run the deployment. Going forward, `p-invitations` and `apps-manager-js` will be disabled from monitoring.

### <a id="dynatrace-post-installation-issues"></a>Applications not Monitored

#### Symptom
Dynatrace UI shows application process or processes for CloudFoundry Applications as requiring a restart for monitoring to be enabled after multiple application restarts.

#### Explanation: Garden container Service Insights not turned on within Dynatrace.
A feature toggle for Garden container support is present in the Dynatrace UI and is not enabled by default.

#### Solution
In the Dynatrace UI, go to **Settings** > **Monitored Technologies** and ensure that the Garden container Service Insights is toggled to on.

Issue a `cf restart` to enable monitoring for that application.
